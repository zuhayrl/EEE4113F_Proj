    abstract={The thermal physiology of most birds and mammals is characterised by considerable spatial and temporal variation in body temperature. Body temperature is, therefore, a key parameter in physiological, behavioural and ecological research. Temperature measurements on freely moving or free-ranging animals in the wild are challenging but can be undertaken using a range of techniques. Internal temperature may be sampled using thermometry, surgically implanted loggers or transmitters, gastrointestinal or non-surgically placed devices. Less invasive approaches measure peripheral temperature with subcutaneous passive integrated transponder tags or skin surface-mounted radio transmitters and data loggers, or use infrared thermography to record surface temperature. Choice of technique is determined by focal research question and region of interest that reflects appropriate physiological or behavioural causal mechanisms of temperature change, as well as welfare and logistical considerations. Particularly required are further studies that provide opportunities of continuously sampling from multiple sites from within the body. This will increase our understanding of thermoregulation and temperature variation in different parts of the body and how these temperatures may change in response to physiological, behavioural and environmental parameters. Technological advances that continue to reduce the size and remote sensing capability of temperature recorders will greatly benefit field research.},

    abstract = {Thermal imaging, or infrared thermography, has been used in avian science since the 1960s. More than 30 species of birds, ranging in size from passerines to ratites, have been studied using this technology. The main strength of this technique is that it is a non-invasive and non-contact method of measuring surface temperature. Its limitations and measurement errors are well understood and suitable protocols have been developed for a variety of experimental settings. Thermal imaging has been used most successfully for research on the thermal physiology of captive species, including poultry. In comparison with work on mammals, thermal imaging has been less used for population counts, other than for some large bird species. However, more recently it has shown greater success for detection of flight paths and migration. The increasing availability and reduced cost of thermal imaging systems is likely to lead to further application of this technology in studies of avian welfare, disease monitoring, energetics, behaviour and population monitoring.},

    abstract = {Surface temperature ($T_{s}$) on most parts of the body of the black-capped chickadee is linearly related to ambient temperature ($T_{a}$) between 27 and -22 C. The slope and intercept of regressions of $T_{s}$ on $T_{a}$ are generally related as predicted by a model developed previously. The head typically has the highest $T_{s}$ of all body parts and accordingly is expected to exhibit the highest rate of heat loss per unit area by convection and radiation at given $T_{a}$. The breast is warmer than the side of the torso, the beak is kept at relatively high $T_{s}$, and $T_{s}$ on the feet and legs is strongly dependent on whether the appendages have recently been ensconced in the ventral plumage. Differences in $T_{s}$ are remarkably small between the chickadee and raven, which represent virtual extremes of body size within the Passeriformes. Metabolic rates of chickadees can be calculated from $T_{s}$ with reasonable success given inadequacies in present knowledge of some relevant parameters. Chickadees show large increases in ptiloerection as $T_{a}$ is lowered in the range of $T_{a}$ well below thermoneutrality; significant consequent changes in plumage conductance, body convection coefficient, and operative body surface area are possible and require appraisal in regard to heattransfer analysis. Subcutaneous temperature may fall significantly with $T_{a}$ on the back and rump but is consistently high on the breast. On the breast the plumage presents most of the resistance to heat flow from bird to environment, and the resistance posed by the living tissues between body core and skin is minor. Plumage and tissue conductances are quantitatively estimated using a new approach based on core temperature, subcutaneous temperature, and $T_{s}$; these estimates are extensively compared with others derived from the literature. Apparently, increases in ptiloerection are accompanied by decreases in plumage conductance but increases in plumage conductivity. The first spectral emittance data to appear in the journal literature for plumage of a bird species at wavelengths longer than 2.5 μm are presented.},

Extreme thermal conditions may dramatically affect the performance of broilers and other domestic animals, thereby impairing animal welfare and causing economic losses. Although body core temperature is the parameter that best reflects a bird's thermal status, practical and physiological obstacles make it irrelevant as a source of information on the thermal status of commercial flocks. Advances in the technology of infrared thermal imaging have enabled highly accurate, noncontact, and noninvasive measurements of skin surface temperature. Providing that skin surface temperature correlates with body temperature, this technology could enable acquisition of reliable information on the thermal status of animals, thereby improving diagnoses of environmental stress in a flock. This study of broiler chickens found a strong positive correlation between body core temperature and facial surface temperature, as recorded by infrared thermal imaging. The correlation was equally strong at all ages from 8 to 36 d during exposure to acute heat stress with or without proper ventilation and after acclimation to chronic heat exposure. A similar correlation was found by measurements in commercial flocks of broilers. Measurements of blood plasma concentrations of corticosterone, thyroid hormones, and arginine vasotocin confirmed that metabolic activity was low after acclimation to chronic exposure to heat, whereas ventilation was at least as efficient as acclimation in reducing thermal stress but did not impair metabolism. In light of these novel results, commercial benefits of infrared thermal imaging technology are suggested, especially in climate control for commercial poultry flocks. The application of this technique to other domestic animals should be investigated in future experiments.}

    abstract = {Abstract In the current context of biodiversity loss through habitat fragmentation, the effectiveness of wildlife crossings, installed at great expense as compensatory measures, is of vital importance for ecological and socio-economic actors. The evaluation of these structures is directly impacted by the efficiency of monitoring tools (camera traps…), which are used to assess the effectiveness of these crossings by observing the animals that use them. The aim of this study was to quantify the efficiency of camera traps in a wildlife crossing evaluation. Six permanent recording video systems sharing the same field of view as six Reconyx HC600 camera traps installed in three wildlife underpasses were used to assess the exact proportion of missed events (event being the presence of an animal within the field of view), and the error rate concerning underpass crossing behavior (defined as either Entry or Refusal). A sequence of photographs was triggered by either animals (true trigger) or artefacts (false trigger). We quantified the number of false triggers that had actually been caused by animals that were not visible on the images (“false” false triggers). Camera traps failed to record 43.6\% of small mammal events (voles, mice, shrews, etc.) and 17\% of medium-sized mammal events. The type of crossing behavior (Entry or Refusal) was incorrectly assessed in 40.1\% of events, with a higher error rate for entries than for refusals. Among the 3.8\% of false triggers, 85\% of them were “false” false triggers. This study indicates a global underestimation of the effectiveness of wildlife crossings for small mammals. Means to improve the efficiency are discussed.},

Given the rapid advances in digital technologies, digital video and photo techniques are becoming more common in use, and publications that introduce a new method or equipment for video surveillance in wildlife research (and in ornithological studies particularly) are appearing almost every year. However, still no special guide to the great variety of equipment and methods is available, and the choice and use of suitable gear for scientific purposes may be difficult for non-specialists. In this paper, we review the most common surveillance techniques used in today's nest studies, as well as the most essential properties of image recording equipment. We also describe the digital video recording technique, which we used for observations of raptor nests, and summarise our experience of its operation. As an example of the obtained data, we present the timing of prey deliveries of goshawks and common buzzards.},

    abstract = {With the increasing popularity of remote photography in wildlife research, a large variety of equipment and methods is available to researchers. To evaluate advantages and disadvantages of using various types of equipment for different study objectives, we reviewed 107 papers that used either time-lapse or animal-triggered photography to study vertebrates in the field. Remote photography was used primarily to study avian nest predation, feeding ecology, and nesting behavior; additional applications included determining activity patterns, presence-absence monitoring, and estimating population parameters. Using time-lapse equipment is most appropriate when animals occur frequently in the photographic frame, the activity of interest occurs repeatedly, or no distinct event occurs to trigger a camera. In contrast, animal-triggered (light or mechanically triggered) systems are appropriate when events occur infrequently or unpredictably and there is a great likelihood that a trigger will be activated. Remote photography can be less time consuming, costly, and invasive than traditional research methods for many applications. However, researchers should be prepared to invest time and money troubleshooting problems with remote camera equipment, be aware of potential effects of equipment on animal behavior, and recognize the limitations of data collected with remote photography equipment.},

    abstract = {Abstract Bespoke (custom-built) Raspberry Pi cameras are increasingly popular research tools in the fields of behavioral ecology and conservation, because of their comparative flexibility in programmable settings, ability to be paired with other sensors, and because they are typically cheaper than commercially built models. Here, we describe a novel, Raspberry Pi-based camera system that is fully portable and yet weatherproof—especially to humidity and salt spray. The camera was paired with a passive infrared sensor, to create a movement-triggered camera capable of recording videos over a 24-hr period. We describe an example deployment involving “retro-fitting” these cameras into artificial nest boxes on Praia Islet, Azores archipelago, Portugal, to monitor the behaviors and interspecific interactions of two sympatric species of storm-petrel (Monteiro's storm-petrel Hydrobates monteiroi and Madeiran storm-petrel Hydrobates castro) during their respective breeding seasons. Of the 138 deployments, 70\% of all deployments were deemed to be “Successful” (Successful was defined as continuous footage being recorded for more than one hour without an interruption), which equated to 87\% of the individual 30-s videos. The bespoke cameras proved to be easily portable between 54 different nests and reasonably weatherproof (~14\% of deployments classed as “Partial” or “Failure” deployments were specifically due to the weather/humidity), and we make further trouble-shooting suggestions to mitigate additional weather-related failures. Here, we have shown that this system is fully portable and capable of coping with salt spray and humidity, and consequently, the camera-build methods and scripts could be applied easily to many different species that also utilize cavities, burrows, and artificial nests, and can potentially be adapted for other wildlife monitoring situations to provide novel insights into species-specific daily cycles of behaviors and interspecies interactions.},

    abstract = {Collisions with windows on buildings are a major source of bird mortality. The current understanding of daytime collisions is limited by a lack of empirical data on how collisions occur in the real world because most data are collected by recording evidence of mortality rather than pre-collision behaviour. Based on published literature suggesting a causal relationship between bird collision risk and the appearance of reflections on glass, the fact that reflections vary in appearance depending on viewing angle, and general principles of object collision kinematics, we hypothesized that the risk and lethality of window collisions may be related to the angle and velocity of birds’ flight. We deployed a home security camera system to passively record interactions between common North American bird species and residential windows in a backyard setting over spring, summer and fall seasons over 2 years. We captured 38 events including 29 collisions and nine near-misses in which birds approached the glass but avoided impact. Only two of the collisions resulted in immediate fatality, while 23 birds flew away immediately following impact. Birds approached the glass at variable flight speeds and from a wide range of angles, suggesting that the dynamic appearance of reflections on glass at different times of day may play a causal role in collision risk. Birds that approached the window at higher velocity were more likely to be immediately killed or stunned. Most collisions were not detected by the building occupants and, given that most birds flew away immediately, carcass surveys would only document a small fraction of window collisions. We discuss the implications of characterizing pre-collision behaviour for designing effective collision prevention methods.},

All have limitations for studying active nests in remote situations, such as size, expense, volume of data recorded, and types of trigger mechanisms. We developed a digital video surveillance system using infrared cameras to monitor predation at bird nests. The main advantage of this system over other video recorders is the small size of the recorder that can run continuously at 29 frames/s for more than 3 days. The recorder's built-in monitor makes it more transportable and allows for easy setup. Digital data is compact, can be reviewed quickly, and requires less physical storage space than videotapes. We recorded nest predation by mammals, birds, and snakes as well as egg and nestling losses not caused by predation. System failure rates were low and the total cost was comparable to (\$700 US) video cassette recorders that are often used to monitor nests.},

Most birds migrate at night through increasingly light-polluted skies. Bright light sources can attract airborne migrants and lead to collisions with structures, but might also influence selection of migratory stopover habitat and thereby acquisition of food resources. We demonstrate, using multi-year weather radar measurements of nocturnal migrants across the northeastern U.S., that autumnal migrant stopover density increased at regional scales with proximity to the brightest areas, but decreased within a few kilometers of brightly-lit sources. This finding implies broad-scale attraction to artificial light while airborne, impeding selection for extensive forest habitat. Given that high-quality stopover habitat is critical to successful migration, and hindrances during migration can decrease fitness, artificial lights present a potentially heightened conservation concern for migratory bird populations.},

Light at night has been associated with health problems in humans as a consequence of altered biological rhythms. Effects on wild animals have been less investigated, but light at night has often been assumed to affect seasonal cycles of urban dwellers. Using light loggers attached to free-living European blackbirds (Turdus merula), we first measured light intensity at night which forest and city birds are subjected to in the wild. Then we used these measurements to test for the effect of light at night on timing of reproductive physiology. Captive city and forest blackbirds were exposed to either dark nights or very low light intensities at night (0.3 lux). Birds exposed to light at night developed their reproductive system up to one month earlier, and also moulted earlier, than birds kept under dark nights. Furthermore, city birds responded differently than forest individuals to the light at night treatment, suggesting that urbanization can alter the physiological phenotype of songbirds. Our results emphasize the impact of human-induced lighting on the ecology of millions of animals living in cities and call for an understanding of the fitness consequences of light pollution. }

    abstract={THE transduction mechanisms and the neurophysiological basis of magnetoreception in birds are still largely unexplained, even though the role of the magnetic compass in the orientation of birds is fairly well understood1. The discussion on magnetoreception in birds and terrestrial vertebrates focuses mainly on two mechanisms: small particles of magnetite2,3 and biochemical bi-radical reactions of excited macromolecules4,5. When the bi-radical hypothesis was first proposed, magnetic resonance phenomena in the retina were suggested as the primary processes4, which led to the question of whether magnetoreception was light-dependent. Homing experiments6 and electrophysiological evidence7 from pigeons have produced evidence consistent with such a mechanism. An effect of the spectral composition of light on magnetic compass orientation in amphibians has recently been described8: under blue light of 450 nm and below, newts oriented as they did under the full spectrum, whereas they showed a roughly 90{\textdegree} counterclockwise shift when tested under wavelengths at or above 500 nm. Here we report the first orientation tests on migratory birds under light of different wavelengths; the results suggest a light-dependent process that appears to differ from that reported in newts.},

    abstract={Biologists have focused their attention on the optical functions of light reflected at ultraviolet and human-visible wavelengths. However, most radiant energy in sunlight occurs in `unseen' near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths. The capacity to reflect solar radiation at NIR wavelengths may enable animals to control heat gain and remain within their critical thermal limits. Here, using a continent-wide phylogenetic analysis of Australian birds, we show that species occupying hot, arid environments reflect more radiant energy in NIR wavelengths than species in thermally benign environments, even when controlling for variation in visible colour. Biophysical models confirm that smaller species gain a greater advantage from high NIR reflectivity in hot, arid environments, reducing water loss from compensatory evaporative cooling by up to 2{\%} body mass per hour. These results highlight the importance of NIR reflectivity for thermal protection, which may become increasingly critical as the frequency of extreme climatic events increases.},

    abstract = {There are several remote-sensing tools readily available for the study of nocturnally flying animals (e.g., migrating birds), each possessing unique measurement biases. We used three tools (weather surveillance radar, thermal infrared camera, and acoustic recorder) to measure temporal and spatial patterns of nocturnal traffic estimates of flying animals during the spring and fall of 2011 and 2012 in Lewes, Delaware, USA. Our objective was to compare measures among different technologies to better understand their animal detection biases. For radar and thermal imaging, the greatest observed traffic rate tended to occur at, or shortly after, evening twilight, whereas for the acoustic recorder, peak bird flight-calling activity was observed just prior to morning twilight. Comparing traffic rates during the night for all seasons, we found that mean nightly correlations between acoustics and the other two tools were weakly correlated (thermal infrared camera and acoustics, r = 0.004 ± 0.04 SE, n = 100 nights; radar and acoustics, r = 0.14 ± 0.04 SE, n = 101 nights), but highly variable on an individual nightly basis (range = −0.84 to 0.92, range = −0.73 to 0.94). The mean nightly correlations between traffic rates estimated by radar and by thermal infrared camera during the night were more strongly positively correlated (r = 0.39 ± 0.04 SE, n = 125 nights), but also were highly variable for individual nights (range = −0.76 to 0.98). Through comparison with radar data among numerous height intervals, we determined that flying animal height above the ground influenced thermal imaging positively and flight call detections negatively. Moreover, thermal imaging detections decreased with the presence of cloud cover and increased with mean ground flight speed of animals, whereas acoustic detections showed no relationship with cloud cover presence but did decrease with increased flight speed. We found sampling methods to be positively correlated when comparing mean nightly traffic rates across nights. The strength of these correlations generally increased throughout the night, peaking 2–3 hours before morning twilight. Given the convergence of measures by different tools at this time, we suggest that researchers consider sampling flight activity in the hours before morning twilight when differences due to detection biases among sampling tools appear to be minimized.},

abstract = {Arduino, an open-source electronics platform, has become the go-to option for anyone working on interactive hardware and software projects. An Arduino board (such as the Uno) connected to a breadboard with plugins such as inputs, sensors, lights, and displays can be controlled by a code written in the Arduino development environment. How to achieve this is by prototyping with Arduino. Prototyping with Arduino has grown in popularity with the increased use of the Arduino platform. Prototyping with Arduino, however, is not an easy task for nonprogrammers with interest in the field. With increased public interest in the field will come a need for accessible information. This paper presents a methodical literature review intended to intensively analyze and compare existing primary studies on prototyping with Arduino. We found about 130 of such studies, all peer-reviewed and published within the last 15 years, including these years (2015–2020). These studies were tediously and carefully chosen through a three-step process. In this paper, a cautious analysis of selected studies was followed by a clear description of the methods applied. The methods were categorized according to the success rate of the studied prototypes. Results obtained can be used in researches on the best technique to adopt while prototyping with Arduino. They can also be used in electronics researches and by individuals who wish to obtain a guide on prototyping with Arduino despite lacking grounded knowledge of the subject matter.},

ABSTRACT = {The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its applications requires high computational efficiency, low-cost, and low-power solutions for various IoT devices. These include a wide range of microcontrollers that are used to collect, process, and transmit IoT data. ESP32 is a microcontroller with built-in wireless connectivity, suitable for various IoT applications. The ESP32 chip is gaining more popularity, both in academia and in the developer community, supported by a number of software libraries and programming languages. While low- and middle-level languages, such as C/C++ and Rust, are believed to be the most efficient, TinyGo and MicroPython are more developer-friendly low-complexity languages, suitable for beginners and allowing more rapid coding. This paper evaluates the efficiency of the available ESP32 programming languages, namely C/C++, MicroPython, Rust, and TinyGo, by comparing their execution performance. Several popular data and signal processing algorithms were implemented in these languages, and their execution times were compared: Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC), Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), Infinite Impulse Response (IIR), and Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters. The results show that the C/C++ implementations were fastest in most cases, closely followed by TinyGo and Rust, while MicroPython programs were many times slower than implementations in other programming languages. Therefore, the C/C++, TinyGo, and Rust languages are more suitable when execution and response time are the key factors, while Python can be used for less strict system requirements, enabling a faster and less complicated development process.},

ABSTRACT = {Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on cheap hardware and the easy-to-use software Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Nowadays, because of its open-source nature and its simple and accessible user experience, Arduino is ubiquitous and used among hobbyist and novice programmers for Do It Yourself (DIY) projects, especially in the Internet of Things (IoT) domain. Unfortunately, such diffusion comes with a price. Many developers start working on this platform without having a deep knowledge of the leading security concepts in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). Their applications, often publicly available on GitHub (or other code-sharing platforms), can be taken as examples by other developers or downloaded and used by non-expert users, spreading these issues in other projects. For these reasons, this paper aims at understanding the current landscape by analyzing a set of open-source DIY IoT projects and looking for potential security issues. Furthermore, the paper classifies those issues according to the proper security category. This study’s results offer a deeper understanding of the security concerns in Arduino projects created by hobbyist programmers and the dangers that may be faced by those who use these projects.},

  abstract={Over the recent years, novel low-power microcontrollers have been introduced. This has allowed the development of various applications, which can operate over long periods of time and fulfill their tasks having very limited amount of energy, such as e.g., Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN).Nonetheless, for fulfilling their tasks such devices in addition to the central processor often have to include several microcontrollers or some peripherals, such as sensors, external memory chips or other application-specific hardware. All those peripherals, except the energy for actual operation also require some energy for communicating to the central processor. In the paper we are investigating and comparing the energy consumption for three most widely used embedded systems' digital serial interfaces, namely I2C, SPI and UART. The presented results have been obtained using the real-life microcontroller (PIC18F family from Microchip) and reveal the energy consumption for different interface implementation methods (hardware vs. software) and various scenarios (idle interface, different data transmit or receive scenarios). The presented data can be valuable as well for researchers and engineers and allow to choose the most energy efficient communication interface and its implementation method to be used in the most energy-critical applications.},

abstract = {Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is an innovative technique that was firstly employed in Bluetooth 4.0 and is being applied in the Bluetooth 5.0 and 5.2 technologies. Bluetooth 5.0 and 5.2 technologies are now widely used in all kinds of electronic communication equipment (e.g., PCs, tablets, smartphones, wearable devices). BLE has the capacity to minimize the power consumption and equipment cost in the low-power devices, which becomes a competitive scheme among the huge number of standard wireless transmission techniques already existing in everyday life for a large number of applications. As one of the available solutions in wireless transmission, Bluetooth technology equipped with the BLE module is very suitable for developing internet of things (IoTs) technology, which is gaining more and more interest. This paper briefly introduces the modulation and encoding of the BLE standard in the physical layer (PHY). The applications of cyclic redundancy check (CRC) in BLE are then presented. Moreover, the main characteristics, including the maximum reachable range, transmission latency, and power consumption of BLE, are also introduced.}
