# Problem statement:
Ben, a PHD student at the Fitz-Patrick Institute, is studying Southern Yellow-billed Hornbills Fork-tailed Drongos in
the Kalahari. He is trying to understand why Hornbill’s breeding success has decreased
with the increasing temperatures while the Drongo’s breeding success has been mostly
unaffected. He needs a way to reliably capture footage and monitor the temperature of the Drongos throughout the day.
